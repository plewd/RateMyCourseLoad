RateMyCourseLoad is a web application designed to assist students in planning their academic schedules effectively.

## Project Overview

RateMyCourseLoad aims to simplify the course planning process for students by leveraging AI technology.
The system analyzes a list of courses a student plans to take, providing advice on credit hours, workload, and the balance between technical and non-technical courses, as well as giving a 1-5 rating to the schedule based on these metrics.
